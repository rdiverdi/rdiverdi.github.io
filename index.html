<p>I enjoy projects which combine elements from many of my interests to create something unique and exciting.  This has led me to the field of robotics, where I continually work on projects which combine important aspects of mechanical design, electrical engineering and software engineering.  I have also been able to combine my love of sailing with my interest in robotics with Olin Robotic Sailing, where we are working on creating an autonomous sailboat capable of sailing across the Atlantic.  For more information on this as well as my projects involving multirotors, hexapods, and other interesting things, please see my <a href="index.html">projects page</a>.  I also love the short period of time in a project during which all of the accumulated work comes together to produce a working product for the first time.  I have been known to stay up for the last night of projects which I have nothing to do with, just to see the  project materialize.  </p>

<p>I've lived in Holden, MA for my whole life, and I've enjoyed golf, sailing, and skiing since I was little.  In middle school, I joined a First Lego League robotics team, and discovered my passion for robotics.  In high school, I changed schools to spend more time on math and science, and to join an FRC robotics team.  My hobbies have shifted with my comfort in different areas.  I have built model boats since I was little, and still do when I have the time, but as I have become more comfortable with software and electronics, I have shifted to experimenting with interesting robots and multi rotors.  </p>
