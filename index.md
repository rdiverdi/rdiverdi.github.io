# My Projects

Below is a quick description of many of my recent projects. Most of them have additional information if you click the title.

## [Autonomous Drone Landing](iv_lab.html)

The Olin Intelligent Vehicles Lab does a lot of work with multirtors, especially in ocean applications; however, flying a drone from a boat requires a skilled pilot to safely recover the drone. In this project, I developed a system capable of using a camera and GPS, which are both common in most drone missions, to detect and land within about 0.5m of a target (as opposed to up to 6m with GPS alone).

**Relevant Skills:** Linux, Python, ROS, Hardware Prototyping, System Design

## Robotic Systems Integration

In this full semsester project, I worked in a team of five to take a semi-functional robot and program it to follow someone, keep track of where it is in a map, and make comments based on the person's location in the building. To robustly follow the target person, we fused camera and lidar data to get a somewhat depth-informed image, which allowed us to consistently detect the person with few false positives. We also developed an angorithm for autonomously calibrating a color threshold for detecting a person's pants. This feature, along with an informative set of light patterns allowed us to develop an intuitive user interaction.

**Relevant Skills:** Linux, C++, ROS, Arduino, Debugging

## Fundamentals of Machine Shop Opperations

The final project for this class was to machine a Tesla Turbine usig a maual lathe, manual mill, and 2 axis CNC mill.

**Relevant Skills:** Machining

This six week project was an entirely open ended project where my team of five decided to build a hexapod robot. By the end of the project, we had a fully functional platform capable of autonomously moving in straight lines and turning.

**Relevant Skills:** Linux, Python, Arduino, Mechanical Design (OnShape), Dynamics, Debugging

## Fundamentals of Robitics

In this final project for Fundamentals of Robotics, I was on a team of three working to make this tugboat autonomousy navigate around a pool using onboard IR distance sensors and an artificial GPS (positions from a ceiling mounted camera)

**Relevant Skills:** LabView

This was a quick project I did at the end of freshmen year in order to explore 3D printing and make myself an interesting toy. My high school robotics team discussed mecanum drive robots a few times but never built one, so I wanted to try it out.

**Relevant Skills:** Mechanical Design (SolidWorks), Rapid Prototyping, Arduino, Electrical Prototyping

This was the first project at Olin. The goal was to design a hopping toy inspired by an insect. This is inspired by the click beetle, which flips istelf over by folding itself in half fast enough to fling itself in the air.

**Relevant Skills:** Mechanical Design (SolidWorks)
