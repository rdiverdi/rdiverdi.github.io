# My Projects

Below is a quick description of many of my recent projects. Most of them have additional information if you click the title.

## [Autonomous Drone Landing](iv_lab.html)

The Olin Intelligent Vehicles Lab does a lot of work with multirtors, especially in ocean applications; however, flying a drone from a boat requires a skilled pilot to safely recover the drone. In this project, I developed a system capable of using a camera and GPS, which are both common in most drone missions, to detect and land within about 0.5m of a target (as opposed to up to 6m with GPS alone).

## [Principles of Engineering](POE.html)

This six week project was an entirely open ended project where my team of five decided to build a hexapod robot. By the end of the project, we had a fully functional platform capable of autonomously moving in straight lines and turning.

## [Mecanum Bot](mecaum.html)

This was a quick project I did at the end of freshmen year in order to explore 3D printing and make myself an interesting toy. My high school robotics team discussed mecanum drive robots a few times but never built one, so I wanted to try it out.

## [Design Nature](des_nat.html)

This was the first project at Olin. The goal was to design a hopping toy inspired by an insect. This is inspired by the click beetle, which flips istelf over by folding itself in half fast enough to fling itself in the air.
