<p>After a year at college and one software class, I decided I wanted to tackle a fun project that involved a rasperry pi.  A lot of times in the lounge, I noticed that we would want music, so someone would start playing music from Spotify, but very quickly a lot of people would request songs, and the person who started the music would end up spennding more time adding songs than doing their work.  To solve this, I decided to set up and program a rasperry pi to act as a Spotify server which would stream music and allow anyone on campus to add and remove songs from a playlist as well as pause, play, and skip</p>
<p>I started with a version of this local to my computer.  It gave me access to pause, play skip,a and last in a very small window which always stays above other windows on my computer.  I then added a feature where, if I drag the window larger, I get a search bar, and I can search spotify for any song and add it to the playlist.  When I'm done, I resize the window back down to its minimum size, and continue to have a small, noninvasive window to control my music.</p>
<p>Once this was working, I shifted to getting it setup on a rasperry pi.  The first issue was figuring out how to make the controls easily accessible to other computers.  To do this, I decided to make the rasperry pi host a webpage on the local network.  That way the system would stay contained at least to a single network to minimize the potential for people not listening to control the music.  To set this up, I learned the basics of Flask along with some of the conventions of webpage hosting, so I was able to access the webpage shown using only the dhcp name of the rasperry pi.  I also learned how to make the pi run a program on startup, so I could plug it in anywhere on campus, and it would automatically start hosting spotify on the Olin network.
